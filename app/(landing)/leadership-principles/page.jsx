        "Our responsibility transcends hitting our goals and KPIs. We know that Xortcut—and the world—will be a better place when people from diverse backgrounds, races, genders, cultures, sexual orientations, ages, and experiences thrive. We work hard to ensure that everyone feels they belong at Xortcut and make the extra effort to bring them in.",

        "We hire, grow, and nurture great people so they can do great things at Xortcut. We provide our teams with direction and context, then trust and empower them to make it happen. Part of empowering your team is understanding that we all make mistakes. We see mistakes as opportunities for learning and development.",

        "Without information and context, Gongsters can’t make decisions and achieve great results. We promote a culture of open information sharing and encourage our teams to communicate transparently across the organization. We err on the side of over-sharing and communicate frequently and clearly to our teams and to our own leadership.",

      title: "ENCOURAGE DEBATE",
      description:
        "We don’t have all the answers. With great people by our side, we listen intently and encourage them to express their ideas and opinions, especially when they are different from our own. We celebrate and encourage their feedback. We don’t make decisions by committee, yet we are genuinely interested in hearing a diverse set of views prior to making a decision.",

      description:
        "We set ambitious goals that feel uncomfortable and are hard to achieve. We are aware we may not fully achieve them, but we’d rather strive for great things than take the easy route. We’re willing to take calculated risks to yield those big outcomes and experiment with new ideas so we can make Xortcut exceptional.",

      title: "MAKE TOUGH CALLS",
      description:
        "As leaders, we’re often required to make uncomfortable decisions that may make us or others around us unhappy. Letting inertia guide us or following the path of least resistance may be easier in the short term, but will not get us to where we need to be. Instead, we act swiftly and decisively, making the best choice for Xortcut.",

This means to continuously improve and be the best at our craft, both within our area of expertise and as leaders. We learn from the best, encourage those who strive to excel, and help our teams achieve higher standards.",
