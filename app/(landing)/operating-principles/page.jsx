      "id": 2,
      "title": "WANT MORE",
      "description": "We are never completely satisfied with our accomplishments. When we achieve new records, we celebrate, and then imagine new ones. Across the product and company we’re building, this applies to everything we do. Every individual and team at Gong strive to be the best at their craft."

      "description": "Conventional wisdom yields conventional results. We want extraordinary results. We encourage ourselves to question common assumptions and 'axioms'. This doesn’t mean we’re doing the opposite of conventional wisdom, but the notion that 'everybody is doing it that way' just doesn’t cut it at Gong."

    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "title": "NO SUGAR",
      "description": "As bitter as they may be, we prefer to know the facts. Sugar-coating does not help make decisions or solve problem quickly. We encourage every Gongster to be direct, speak their mind, and expect the same from their peers."
