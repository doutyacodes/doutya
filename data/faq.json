      "question": "What is Xortcut?",
      "answer": "Xortcut is an AI-powered Career Guidance Cell for schools and colleges. Instead of a one-time career test, it gives every learner a living roadmap with monthly milestones, knowledge assessments, real-world challenges, and bi-monthly feedback reports."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Xortcut different from a normal career test?",
      "answer": "Traditional tests give static results. Xortcut is agentic AI — it tracks progress month by month, adapts to changes in interests, and ensures students stay on a guided path from Class 5 to 12."
    },
    {
      "question": "From what age can a student use Xortcut?",
      "answer": "From Class 5 onwards.\n\nClasses 5–7: explore sectors (broad fields like Tech, Healthcare, Law, Arts).\n\nClasses 8–10: narrow into clusters (focused areas like Engineering, Design, Finance).\n\nClasses 11–12: decide on specific careers (e.g., Ethical Hacker, CA, IAS, Pilot)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Xortcut replace school counselors?",

  "For Parents / Students": [
    {
      "question": "Who sees my child’s career report?",
      "answer": "Your child’s detailed report belongs to you and your family. Schools only see batch-level insights (e.g., how many are interested in Science vs Commerce). Sharing of individual reports with schools is consent-based."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often will we get updates?",
      "answer": "Every two months, you receive a feedback report highlighting achievements, gaps, and next steps. You can also check progress anytime in the portal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my child changes their career interest?",
      "answer": "That’s expected. Xortcut supports multiple career slots. You can select 3 (standard) or upgrade to 6. Students can add or switch careers as they grow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can my child choose unusual careers (like Sports, Esports, Priest, NBA player)?",
      "answer": "Yes. We allow custom careers in addition to curated ones. Xortcut adapts milestones and challenges to keep passion alive."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we plan for studying or working abroad?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can set a country of education and a desired country of work. Xortcut adapts the roadmap (exams, licensing, scholarships, immigration notes)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is progress measured?",
      "answer": "Not by one long % bar. Students see:\n\nAnnual milestones completed (e.g., 9/12 this year).\n\nStreaks (consistency).\n\nBadges for achievements (Resilience, Research, Communication).\n\nYear-end summaries with clear takeaways."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this add pressure to my child?",
      "answer": "No. Milestones and challenges are age-appropriate. For Class 5, a “challenge” could be visiting an airport or making a paper plane. For Class 12, it could be drafting a CV or solving a mock case study."
